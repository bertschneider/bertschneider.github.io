# About the author

This blog is some kind of technical diary. I try to post interesting
stuff I am working on during my quest to become a better person in
general and a greater geek in particular. Hopefully some people will
find the posts interesting.

You can reach me at mail@herr-norbert.de

My PGP key can be found [here on the page](../resources/key.txt) or on the usual key servers.
