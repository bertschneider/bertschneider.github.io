Generally I don't like blogging very much. I like blogs, don't get me
wrong, but I never really got into blogging myself. I can't help
it but recently I decided to give it _another_ try.

On the other hand I like [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org) very much and in the last few
weeks my Wordpress installation, although never used very much, filled up my whole
webspace. So a decision was made ... Clojure-Blogging to the rescue.

Like you can guess this is my first blog post using the solution. I
switched to [static](http://github.com/nakkaya/static). Like the name
suggests it is a static site generator written in Clojure by [Nurullah
Akkaya](http://twitter.com/nakkaya).

Well, I still have to get used to this kind of blogging. But as far as
I can tell from my first few tests I really like it!

Most of the design is still by [Nurullah
Akkaya](http://twitter.com/nakkaya) and can be found at [GitHub](http://github.com/nakkaya/nakkaya.com).

So stay tuned and _don't Panic!_
