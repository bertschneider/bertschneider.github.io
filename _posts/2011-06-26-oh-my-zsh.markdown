# oh-my-zsh

I few days ago I stumbled upon
[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). It's a
collection of scripts, plugins and themes to manage and extend the
[zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) shell.

I am not a shell ninja, nevertheless I like a good shell configuration
and [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is really
great in this sense.

The plugins and themes are especially noteworthy. Have a look at the
next screenshot. It shows a really informative prompt and the git
status from the current directory.
